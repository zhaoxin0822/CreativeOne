           <h2>Uranus</h2>
          <p>
             Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest planetary radius and 
             fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, 
             and both have different bulk chemical composition from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter 
             and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to 
             distinguish them from the gas giants. Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's 
             in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices" such as water, 
             ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons.It is the coldest planetary 
             atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F), and has a 
             complex, layered cloud structure with water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost 
             layer of clouds.[12] The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.
         </p>
         <p>
              Uranus is the only planet whose name is derived directly from a figure from Greek mythology, 
              from the Latinised version of the Greek god of the sky Ouranos. Like the other giant planets, 
              Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous moons. The Uranian system has a unique 
              configuration among those of the planets because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly 
              into the plane of its solar orbit. Its north and south poles, therefore, lie where most other 
              planets have their equators. In 1986, images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost 
              featureless planet in visible light, without the cloud bands or storms associated with the 
              other giant planets. Observations from Earth have shown seasonal change and increased 
              weather activity as Uranus approached its equinox in 2007. Wind speeds can reach 250 metres 
              per second (900 km/h; 560 mph).

              <h2>Neptune</h2>
          <p>
              
              Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System. 
              In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the 
              third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. Neptune is 17 times 
              the mass of Earth and is slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus, which 
              is 15 times the mass of Earth and slightly larger than Neptune.[d] Neptune orbits 
              the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 astronomical units 
              (4.50×109 km). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical 
              symbol ♆, a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident. 
         </p>
         <p>
              Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar 
              System found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. 
              Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its 
              orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. Neptune was 
              subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle
              within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier. Its largest moon, 
              Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining
              known 13 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's
              distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to 
              study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew 
              by the planet on 25 August 1989. The advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and 
              large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional 
              detailed observations from afar.
