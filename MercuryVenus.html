              <h2>Mercury</h2>
          <p>
              
              Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. Its orbital period around the Sun 
              of 88 days is the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System. It is named after the Roman deity M
              ercury, the messenger to the gods.
              Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and never exceeds 28° 
              away from the Sun. When viewed from Earth, this proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen 
              near the western or eastern horizon during the early evening or early morning. At this time it may appear
              as a bright star-like object, but is often far more difficult to observe than Venus. The planet telescopically 
              displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, as it moves in its inner orbit relative
              to Earth, which reoccurs over the so-called synodic period approximately every 116 days.
         </p>
         <p>
             Mercury is gravitationally locked with the Sun in a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, and rotates in a way that 
             is unique in the Solar System. As seen relative to the fixed stars, it rotates on its axis exactly three times 
             for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun.[a][16] As seen from the Sun, in a frame of reference that 
             rotates with the orbital motion, it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian years. An observer on 
             Mercury would therefore see only one day every two years.

              <h2>Venus</h2>
          <p>
              
              Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7 Earth days.It has the longest rotation period (243 days) of 
              any planet in the Solar System and rotates in the opposite direction to most other planets. It has no natural satellites. It 
              is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. It is the second-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon,
              reaching an apparent magnitude of −4.6 – bright enough to cast shadows at night and, rarely, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight. 
              Orbiting within Earth's orbit, Venus is an inferior planet and never appears to venture far from the Sun; its maximum angular distance from the Sun (elongation) is 47.8°.
         </p>
         <p>
              Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet" because of their similar size, mass, proximity to 
              the Sun, and bulk composition. It is radically different from Earth in other respects. It has the densest atmosphere of the four 
              terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is 92 times that 
              of Earth, or roughly the pressure found 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Venus is by far the hottest planet in the Solar System,
              with a mean surface temperature of 735 K (462 °C; 863 °F), even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Venus is shrouded by an opaque 
              layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from space in visible light. It may have 
              had water oceans in the past,[15][16] but these would have vaporized as the temperature rose due to a runaway greenhouse effect.
              The water has probably photodissociated, and the free hydrogen has been swept into interplanetary space by the solar wind because of 
              the lack of a planetary magnetic field.Venus's surface is a dry desertscape interspersed with slab-like rocks and is periodically resurfaced by volcanism.
