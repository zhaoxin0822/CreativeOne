          <h2>Jupiter</h2>
          <p>
              Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant 
              planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the 
              other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants; the other two 
              giant planets, Uranus and Neptune are ice giants. Jupiter has been known to astronomers since 
              antiquity. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter.When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach 
              an apparent magnitude of −2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows,and making 
              it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.
          </p>
          <p>
             Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium, though helium 
             comprises only about a tenth of the number of molecules. It may also have a rocky core of heavier 
             elements,but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of 
             its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight but noticeable 
             bulge around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different 
             latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result 
             is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century 
             when it was first seen by telescope. Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful
             magnetosphere. Jupiter has at least 69 moons,including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo 
             Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.

              <h2>Saturn</h2>
          <p>
              Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average 
              radius about nine times that of Earth. It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, but with its larger volume Saturn is over
              95 times more massive.Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture; its astronomical symbol (♄) represents the god's sickle.
          </p>
          <p>
              Saturn's interior is probably composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). This core is surrounded by
              a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally a gaseous outer layer. Saturn 
              has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. Electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought 
              to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due 
              to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere is generally bland 
              and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h (1,100 mph), higher than on 
              Jupiter, but not as high as those on Neptune.
