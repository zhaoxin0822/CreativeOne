              <h2>Mars</h2>
          <p>
              Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury. 
              In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman god of war, and is often referred to as the "Red Planet
              because the reddish iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance that is distinctive 
              among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.[16] Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere,
              having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar
              ice caps of Earth.</p>
          <p>
           The rotational period and seasonal cycles of Mars are likewise similar to those of Earth, as is the tilt that 
           produces the seasons. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and second-highest known mountain 
           in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis 
           basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature. Mars has two moons, 
           Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids, similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan. </p>

              <h2>Earth</h2>
          <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating 
          and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, 
          especially the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite. Earth revolves around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an 
          Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.[n 5]
          Earth's axis of rotation is tilted, producing seasonal variations on the planet's surface.The gravitational interaction between the 
          Earth and Moon causes ocean tides, stabilizes the Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation.Earth is the densest
          planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.    
          </p>
         <p>
             Earth's lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions
             of years. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water, mostly by oceans.The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents
             and islands that together have many lakes, rivers and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere. The majority of Earth's 
             polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. Earth's interior remains active 
             with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates the Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.
